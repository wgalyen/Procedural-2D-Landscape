# Procedural 2D Landscape
Procedural generation of a landscape with forests and mountains in using only basic shapes.

Only using basic shapes (circles, squares, triangles) in javascript.

The goal is to make it look like a painting, by drawing far away feature first.

TODO:
- better mountains (roughness)
- better performance
- lakes with reflection
- animation (sun, clouds, leaves/wind)
